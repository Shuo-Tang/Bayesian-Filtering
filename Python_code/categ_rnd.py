	CATEG_RND  Draws samples from a given one dimensional discrete distribution
	
	Syntax:
	  C = CATEG_RND(P,N)
	
	In:
	  P - Discrete distribution, which can be a numeric array
	      of probabilities or a cell array of particle structures,
	      whose weights represent the distribution.
	  N - Number of samples (optional, default 1)
	
	Out:
	  C - Samples in a Nx1 vector
	
	Description:
	  Draw random category
