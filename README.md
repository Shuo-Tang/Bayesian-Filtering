# Code for Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing

This repo contains some demos which accompany the [Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing](https://users.aalto.fi/~ssarkka/pub/cup_book_online_20131111.pdf) by Simo Särkkä.

Along with the original code provided with the book (available on
the book’s web page: https://www.cambridge.org/sarkka) I have included the Python code.

To view and execute the Jupyter notebooks in the cloud, simply press the launch-Binder button above, wait a few moments for the requirements to be fulfilled and then navigate to the desired demo file.

All the errors in the Python notebooks and scripts are obviously mine.
