# Code for Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing

This repo contains some demos which accompany the [Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing](https://www.cambridge.org/sarkka) by Simo Särkkä.

Along with the original code provided with the book (see link above) I have included the Python code.

To view and execute the Jupyter notebooks in the cloud, simply press the Binder button below, wait a few moments for the requirements to be fulfilled and then navigate to the desired demo file.

All the errors in the Python notebooks and scripts are obviously mine.
